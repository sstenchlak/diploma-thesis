\begin{requirement}
    The application shall create supporting documents for the generated schemas.
\end{requirement}

As the application's main goal should be to generate schemas, we also need to create documentation for them, diagrams, and examples. This requirement has already been described in the introduction chapter.

Schemas use things from ontology, a complex graph of different concepts and relations. To let users better understand it, a diagram of a subset of the ontology used by the given schema may be extremely beneficial. % todo jeste se na to podivat

For the schema in the \autoref{analysis/general-schema-representation}, Figures \ref{analysis/xml-json} and \ref{analysis/csv} are examples that can be automatically generated. This would require additional knowledge from the ontology as the application needs to understand that the title should be a buyable item and the price should correspond to the item's actual price. % todo splitnout a dat do future requirements
