\section{CIM layer}

The topmost layer recognized by the model is CIM - \textit{Computation Independent Model} from model-driven architecture. CIM represents the source ontology on the Internet from which the user can build the schemas. To properly define the CIM Layer, we first need to define the PIM layer.

\paragraph{Definition} PIM layer $\textrm{PIM}$ is a tuple $PIM = (C, A)$ where the following are defined:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition by PIM (must be stable, function from CIM to PIM)
    \item Antidefinitions, how we use interpret it (changes, not available)
\end{itemize}

\section{PIM layer}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Why this PIM - maybe link to UFO?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{user PIM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item definition, analysis, implementation
\end{itemize}

\section{PSM layer}

\begin{itemize}
    \item General definition - most unique
    \item analysis of basic constructs that may be used, OR and INCLUDE analysis
    \item News compared to old version - reuse
\end{itemize}
