\section{OSLO}

OSLO\footnote{\url{https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/oslo-open-standards-linked-organisations-0/about}} - Open Standards for Linked Organisations is an initiative that originated in Flanders, Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, to promote the use of technical standards for the data exchange between various organizations, government, and a local government. The goal of OSLO is to maintain and create the standards through the open process (hence everyone can intervene), keep the rules respected, provide a publication platform and support the adoption of the standards. So far, OSLO contains over 18 different domains consisting of definitions from 107 organizations.

The initiative developed a toolchain to ease the process of publication of the standards. The standards are modeled in \textit{Enterprise Architect UML} software and then converted into an RDF representation with their tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/OSLO-EA-to-RDF}}. The next tool then generates artifacts (resulting files) that are automatically published on one centralized server \url{https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns}. The artifacts contain HTML documentation, RDF vocabulary, SHACL\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/}} templates for validation of RDF, and a JSON-LD\footnote{\url{https://json-ld.org/}} context for developers that prefer JSON formats. Their toolchain uses the GitHub platform for storing their standards and triggering the rest of the toolchain. They also provide tools for organizations to validate their data against the standards to check that data are machine-readable without errors.

OSLO also focuses on the interoperability of services that provide those data so that every service has a generic hyper-media-driven API.

\medskip

Compared to our approach, OSLO's primary focus is on the interoperability of public services and their data in LOD format. Their goal is to provide a set of tools to create and later validate public services effectively. Our approach is to design a general tool (hence it can be used for any related purpose, such as software development process) for services that use non-RDF formats, such as CSV or XML files, and provide tools to convert them to linked data format.

As noted in the introduction chapter, we also focus on the public sector, but only as one of many use-cases. Hence, in general, their approach is better suited for the public sector as their tool may be better suited to the problem.

\section{LinkML}

LinkML is a general-purpose language and a tool using YAML for modeling schemas that can be converted to various formats such as JSON, CSV, SQL and RDF schemas, or Python Dataclasses. It also generates human-readable documentation with diagrams and can validate the data in different formats. It is written in Python.

        identifier: true

        required: true

      aliases:
        multivalued: true
        description: other names for the person

      age:
        range: integer
        minimum_value: 0
        maximum_value: 200

The core concepts in their model are classes with properties. Classes then support inheritance and the model in general supports many options for the data types, cardinalities, regular expression patterns, and others.

Nevertheless, the main input of the framework is the YAML file where the ontology needs to be defined and then the tool generates artifacts. This is a completely different concept than we have, as the ontology already exists and we model the schemas. It seems, that the tool does not let the user choose what to include to the schema in such granularity as our tool does.

Based on how the framework is used, we suppose, that it targets the former use-case from the introduction: to create schemas for (micro)service architecture. The lack of UI makes it difficult to use outside this case.
