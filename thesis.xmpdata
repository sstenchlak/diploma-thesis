\Title{Model-driven approach for data schema definitions modeling}
\Keywords{schema definition\sep  data modeling\sep  ontologies\sep  Model-Driven Architecture}
\Subject{This work analyzes, formalizes, and implements a framework for multi-level conceptual modeling of various serialization formats based on Model-Driven Architecture and previously developed tools XCase and eXolutio. It enables users to model their schema from a conceptual model in one general form from which multiple schema formats can be derived alongside documentation and transformation scripts. The thesis introduces base formalisms and findings and analyzes advanced requirements for the following work in this area, such as evolution and inheritance of schemas. The primary use case of the tool is modeling formal open standards for publishing open data for the government and public institutions of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, the intent is to make the tool for general schema modeling.}
